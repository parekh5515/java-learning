ðŸ”¹ Basic OOP Concepts in Java (Using Your Code)
1. Class:

A blueprint for creating objects.

Example: public class Opps1 is a class.

Object:

2. An instance of a class (real-world entity).

Example: Opps1 o1 = new Opps1(); creates an object o1.

Fields (Instance Variables):

Variables inside a class but outside methods.

Example: String name; int rollNo;

Methods:

Functions inside a class that define behavior.

Example: printDetails() prints object data.

3. Encapsulation:

Wrapping data and methods in a class.

Your class groups name, rollNo, and printDetails() together.

Access Modifiers:

Control visibility.

public means accessible from anywhere.
