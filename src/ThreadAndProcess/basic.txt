//////   Process:::

process is an instance of program that is getting executed.
it has its own resources like memory,thread etc. OS allocates these resources to process when it is created


compilation: generate byte code that can be executed by machine
execution: at this point, jvm starts new process



/////                        Thread:

- Thread is known as light wight process
or
smallest sequence of instruction that are executed by cpu independently

- one process can have multiple threads

- when a process is created it starts with one thread and that initial thread is known as main thread and from
that we can create multiple thread to perform task concurrently.

example:

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Thread Name: "+ Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
output is: Thread Name: main
